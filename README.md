## What is this?

Documenting my learning journey, using this repository to store carefully curated content that may be useful to look back on for future references. Many of the content within is inspired from my learning experiences from various platforms such as AlgoExpert, codeguppy, YouTube, and other various online resources that will be sourced in the future.

## Why did I create this?

This repository has _practical_ content that covers a lot of technical interview questions, I plan on adding more to this as I learn more about data structures & algorithms. As I improve more on JavaScript and Python, I will continue to add more code from my learning experiences here. Include coding challenges and syntax questions and maybe one day create a document application for all the information here.

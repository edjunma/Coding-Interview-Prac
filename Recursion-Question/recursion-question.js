// Alice and Bob are playing a game using a bunch of coins.The players pick several coins out of the bunch in turn. Each time a player is allowed to pick 1, 2, or 4 coins, and the player that gets the last coin is the winner. Given the number of coins and the names of the two players, you are required to write a program to calculate all the possible ways that the game can play out.

const coinGame = () => {};

console.log(coinGame(5, ['alice', 'bob']));
